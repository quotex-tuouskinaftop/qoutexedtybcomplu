## Broker Violations and Abnormal Records

-   2022-12-18 BrokersView has Reviewed that Quotex is an Unregulated
    Broker
-   2023-01-02 The Portugal CMVM Added Quotex into Its Warnings
-   2023-01-02 BrokersView has Found that Quotex is Using New Domains
-   2023-09-26 BrokersView notices that the SVG FSA no longer includes
    information related to Quotex

Quotex claims to be owned and operated by Maxbit LLC, a company
registered in St. Vincent and Grenadines. We indeed find a match result
to Maxbit LLC in St. Vincent and Grenadines Financial Services Authority
(SVG FSA). But SVG FSA is not a financial regulator that issues licenses
for forex trading or regulates entities engaging in forex.

More important, the Italy Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la
Borsa (CONSOB) issued a warning against Maxbit LLC for providing
investment, financial services without required authorizations.

The truth is, Quotex is not under valid regulation by any regulators to
provide investment services. Investors\' funds in this company are
unsafe and cannot be protected by any law. Therefore, it is a scam.
